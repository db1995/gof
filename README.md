Thinking in "GoF" design patterns
# **The primary goals of this project:**
1. Thinking "Gof" design patterns deeply by a variety of demos.
2. Develop the habit of writing elegant codes.

### How to learn?
When you learn each design pattern, you can read the demos one by one.

There is a Main class in each demo package.

You can read the comment to understand what it is.

Furthermore, you can run the main method and you will see the result.

### Notice:
There are some directory named "extra" in behavioral, creational and structural directory.

The "extra" directory stores the others design patterns witch are not belong with the "GoF".
